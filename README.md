# electronjs first app
 My first experience with electron js

 - Simple applications - window with input form, and button that onclick will take input text as url and perform get request - done.
 - Project folder structuring - done.
 - Installed and tested electron-builder. In its default, he create classic "next-next-next" installer - done.
